# Quake Log Parser

## Features

- **Parse Quake 3 Arena Log Files**: Efficiently processes large log files generated by the Quake 3 Arena server.
- **Game Grouping**: Automatically detects and groups data by game sessions.
- **Player Statistics**: Tracks players, their kills, and how they were killed.
- **Kill Method Analysis**: Groups kills by the method of death for each match.
- **Flexible Input**: Can read log data from various sources using the `io.Reader` interface.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or later

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rarfael/quake-log-parser.git
cd quake-log-parser
```
### Running the Parser

To run the parser and generate reports, ensure that you have a log file (`quake.log`) in the project directory:

```bash
go run main.go
```
## Project Structure

- **`main.go`**: Entry point of the application. Handles file input and invokes the parsing and reporting functions.
- **`parser.go`**: Contains the logic for parsing the log file and extracting game-related data.
- **`reports.go`**: Responsible for generating structured reports from the parsed data.
- **`parser_test.go`**: Contains unit tests for the game parsing functionality.
- **`reports_test.go`**: Contains unit tests for the report generation functionality.

## Example Output

Hereâ€™s an example of the structured output generated by the parser:

```json
"game_1": {
  "total_kills": 45,
  "players": ["Dono da bola", "Isgalamido", "Zeh"],
  "kills": {
    "Dono da bola": 5,
    "Isgalamido": 18,
    "Zeh": 20
  },
  "kills_by_means": {
    "MOD_SHOTGUN": 10,
    "MOD_RAILGUN": 2,
    "MOD_GAUNTLET": 1
  }
}
```
## Testing

The project includes a suite of unit tests to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the log parser.

### Running Tests

To run the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
go test ./...
```
### Test Coverage

The tests cover various scenarios including:
- Multiple games within a single log file
- Games with no kills
- Handling of kills by `<world>`
- Edge cases such as no players in a game
